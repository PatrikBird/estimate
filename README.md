## TODO
- [ ] provide switch to observer/voter via shortcut/click
- [ ] implement `reveal vote` and `reset vote`
- [ ] provide `vote result overview` after they have been revealed
- [ ] vote for a break

## Improvements
- [ ] clear localStorage if DB document(user) gets deleted, that'd prompt the modal and everyone could delete every user
